        "content": "\nI have implemented the stakingContract as per your instructions. Here's a summary of what I did:\n\n1. Created a contract with functions for staking, withdrawing, and claiming rewards.\n2. Implemented a reward calculation mechanism based on the time elapsed and the amount staked.\n3. Added events for better monitoring of staking, withdrawing, and claiming rewards.\n4. Used OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard and Ownable for security and ownership management.\n5. Included functions for the owner to set the reward rate and withdraw excess tokens.\n\nCaveats and assumptions:\n- The contract assumes that the staking token and reward token are different. If they are the same, you may need to adjust the implementation.\n- The reward rate is set to 100 tokens per second by default. You should adjust this based on your specific requirements.\n- The contract addresses for staking and reward tokens are placeholders. You must replace these with actual token addresses before deployment.\n\nInstructions for deployment and interaction:\n1. Replace the placeholder addresses for stakingToken and rewardToken in the constructor with actual token addresses.\n2. Deploy the contract.\n3. Ensure that the contract has a sufficient balance of reward tokens.\n4. Users need to approve the contract to spend their staking tokens before calling the stake function.\n5. The owner can adjust the reward rate using the setRewardRate function if needed.\n\nRemember to thoroughly test the contract in a test environment before deploying it to the mainnet.\n",
